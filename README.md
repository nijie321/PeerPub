# PeerPub 
 Tracking two rats independently during oral operant self-administration of solutions (e.g. sucrose, alcohol, opioids).

## Program Structure

   Main Program: main.py (main_test.py) is the entry program. This program handles session command and rat ID
   scanning, adjusting the pump position, and finally calling the operant.py as a subprocess.
   Note that this program does not exit after calling the subprocess. It it kept alive, as the
   main thread, to record rat's ID when they poke their head near the antenna. Rat's ID are
   stored in _active and _inactive files located in the /home/pi/ directory.
   
   Operant Program: operant.py (operant_test.py) is the program which main invoke at the end of it's executation.
   This program handles saving each data point to corresponding data files.

   Pump Driver Program: pump_move.py is the program that is used, as a higher level abstraction, to drive the stepper motor using underlying gpiozero/RPi.GPIO library. This program mainly consist of the PumpMove class which contains a move() class for "rotating" the motor (forward and backward). The __del__ method need to be call at the end of each use to 'shutoff' the motor. This prevent the motor driver from overheating (there are more efficient ways to do this).
   
   Activity Counter Program: Rat's activity (inactive lick, active lick, and etc) are being represent as an instance of RatActivityCounter.

   PumpCalibration Program: Currently, the motor step size is not accurate enough. The pump's step need to be modified from time to time. This program prompt the user to measure the amount of solution the pump push out and enter that amount. Then the program will automatically re-adjust the step size.
   

## Configuration
   - Files

     - /home/pi/peerpub_config.json
        This file stores 3 information: device ID, session number/ID, and stepper motor step size. (The session number is increament by 1 each time the program start)

     - /home/pi/openbehavior/PeerPub/python/session_configuration.csv
        This file is used by the program to read in the session information. 

     - /home/pi/openbehavior/PeerPub/python/config.py
        This file stores different directory paths. Note that these path are all absolute paths. There's a "get_sessioninfo" function which takes in a argument "sessionid" to retrive session information from "session_configuration.csv" mentioned above. A good practice is to put related configuration functions in this file and import then when needed.

## Utility Scripts

   **check_empty_program.sh**: a script that check the size of every python file in the python/ directory. If one or more files are empty the script then reclone the entire repository.

   **check_network.sh**: a script that check the network connection right after the device boots up and ask user for action when the device was not able to connect to network.
